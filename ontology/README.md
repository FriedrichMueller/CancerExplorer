# Cancer Cause-Effect Relationship Domain Ontology
### A domain ontology for knowledge representation of cancer related cause-effect relationships

## Introduction
The background information about these relationships is derived from monographies of The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC http://www.iarc.fr/).
Hereby, the information exists as plain text and has to be worked out by analysing and structuring the textual information in order to transform it into 
the domain ontology structure. The ontology creation was conducted by using the free, open-source ontology editor Protégé (http://protege.stanford.edu/).


## Use case
Moreover the domain ontology covers the chain linkage: cancer type (e.g. lung cancer) – carcinogen (e.g. diesel exhaust particulates)
– emission process (e.g. driving) – transport way (e.g. aerosol) – emission source (e.g. car) – exponent (e.g. males/females).
The cancer types, the focus lies on, are lung, bladder, leukemia, nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancer.


## Purpose
The ontology is the core of the CancerExplorer application because the ontology sets
with classes, properties and instances cancer related relationships. Relations like what kind of
carcinogen causes primarily a certain type of cancer and structures information like about emitter,
transport ways, exponent locations and exponent groups.

This ontology can be re-used fully or in parts to express cause-effect relationships or as a common ground for converting other cancer data sources. 

## Features

It represents information about:
- Carcinogens
- Consumption of the carcinogens
- Emission sources
- Emission process
- Substance transport
- Exponent groups (e.g. profession groups)
- Exponent regions 
- Exponent gender
- Links to other information sources
