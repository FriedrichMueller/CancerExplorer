# Example: Information harvesting & RDF creation script


## Use case

e.g. no API or other interfaces are available for information retrieval e.g. pure HTML embedded information
or other saving work load reasons 




## Pros&Cons

**Pros**
- can save workload
- data can be streamed and further processed
- sometimes the only way to retrieve big data sets

**Cons**
- can be against some terms of use of an website
- high programming workload
- not stable -> if the website changes, the application can brake or even more worse it can get wrong results
