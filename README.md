# CancerExplorer


## Linked Data-Based Spatial Cause-Effect Relationships Explorer


### Introduction
The project deals with cancer related cause-effect relationships. Moreover, which aim is to create a
web-based assistance system for the exploration of cause-effect relationships of selected cancer
types in a predefined geographic region.
The work is a result of an external semester contribution, which was mainly focused on the modelling part (domain ontology, information aggregation).


### Purpose
The purpose of the system is to communicate spatial interdisciplinary information to the user like
the distribution of emission sources of carcinogens or what kind of prevailing substances are at the
same time carcinogens and cause primarily a certain cancer type, but not to make decisive analysis
possible.
The application presents possible causes for high cancer incidence rates in a spatial context. It does so, by
using the chain linking of different variables that is encoded as linked data.

  
### Status
This is an early development step version.

Presented statistical epidemiological values (SIR and CI values):
For demonstration purpose only random example values are integrated. The values are generated randomly for each new query.


This brings along:

- First insights of possibilities of the CancerExplorer
- Limited information retrieval (for development purposes only a test RDF repository can be queried) 
- Long list of issues (refresh your browser view after broken queries)

Overview:

Detail view:
It is possible to receive detailed information about emitter and their emissions.

Explorer view:
The view helps to explore epidemiological and environmental data in a parallel way.
This interactive visual representations allows the user to detect patterns and structures in the
data that are difficult to realise in a non-visual way

By providing interactivity, meaningful visualisations to accompany the
maps, users are supported in making interpretations of maps while reflecting on the underlying
uncertainty.
